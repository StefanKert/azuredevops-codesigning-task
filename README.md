# Code Signing task

Build task for Azure DevOps that gives the user the ability to codesign assemblies and applications.

## Usage

Add a new task, select **Code Signing** from the **Utility** category and configure it as needed.

![Code Signing parameters](images/usage-parameters.png)

Parameters include:

- **Secure File**: The certificate that was uploaded to `Secure Files` to be used to sign the given files. ([Using Secure Files in Azure DevOps](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/library/secure-files?view=azure-devops&viewFallbackFrom=vsts)).
- **Secure File Password**: The password for the provided certificate. Use a new variable with its lock enabled on the Variables tab to encrypt this value.
- **File(s) to Sign**: Relative path from the repo root to the file(s) you want to sign. You can use wildcards to specify multiple files ([more information](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/file-matching-patterns?view=azure-devops)). For example, **/bin/*.dll for all .DLL files in the 'bin' subfolder.
- **Timestamp Server Url**: Absolute Url of the timestamp server to use.. Default: http://timestamp.digicert.com
- **Hashing Algorithm**: The file digest algorithm to use for creating file signatures (i.e. SHA256 or SHA1). Default: SHA256
- **Select singtool.exe**: Option to select signtool to use for signing
    - Built-In: This is the default option. It uses the signtool.exe that comes along with the task
    - Custom Path: With this option you can define a custom path that the task will use to sign your files. IMPORTANT: the custompath has to end with `signtool.exe`
    - Latest version installed: This option uses the latest installed version on the current system. This only works on machines that have the Windows 10 SDK installed. The base path that is used for getting the signtool is `C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\bin`. The task grabs the latest installed version and tries to use the `x64` version of the .exe. If it is not available it uses `x86`. If the `x86` signtool is not available the task fails. If this is the case please check if the Windows 10 SDK is installed on your build agent. 
- **Description**: A description to add to the file being signed

## Supported filetypes

- .dll, .exe
